## Installation

```pip install auto-wrench```

## What is Wrench?

Wrench is a workflow framework to build pipelines for automated registration and enrichment of sensor metadata for IoT devices and sensors into data catalogs. Extract, process, and enrich metadata from various sensor data sources into various urban data catalogs.

Wrench provides generic contracts for different components so that it can be extended to harvest from different IoT data sources and register to various urban data catalogs.

The objectives of wrench are:

- Discoverability: Easier to find sensor data in data catalogs.
- Enrichment: Meaningful descriptions and metadata in catalog entries.
- Extensible: Easy to create new components to use in the pipeline.
- Ease-of-use: Reasonable default configuration, easy to setup and run.
- Automation: Fully automated workflows with LLM agents assisting registration.

## Usage

### Basic Example

The example below sets up a pipeline with a SensorThings API harvester and an SDDI catalogger, with a grouper using TELEClass classifier. More documentation on the components can be found on the documentation page.

```py
from wrench.catalogger.sddi import SDDICatalogger
from wrench.common.pipeline import Pipeline
from wrench.grouper.teleclass.core.teleclass import TELEClassGrouper
from wrench.harvester.sensorthings import SensorThingsHarvester
from wrench.harvester.sensorthings.contentgenerator import ContentGenerator
from wrench.harvester.sensorthings.models import GenericLocation

pipeline = Pipeline(
    harvester=SensorThingsHarvester(
        config="test_script/sta_config.yaml",content_generator=ContentGenerator(config="test_script/generator_config.yaml",
    ),
    grouper=TELEClassGrouper(config="test_script/teleclass_config.yaml"),
    catalogger=SDDICatalogger(config="test_script/sddi_config.yaml"),
    )
)

pipeline.run()

```

## Configuration

The system can be configured through a YAML file:

```bash
```
